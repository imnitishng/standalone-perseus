However, we can trust that an individual\n    string is in its entirety either escaped or not. This will allow us to use\n    a heuristic to determine with a high probability whether a string is\n    escaped or not, and thus whether to unescape it or not in\n    our `before_dom_insert()` JIPT hook.\n\n    TODO(aasmund): Delete this file when we have converted all our strings\n    to the new, unescaped Crowdin format. Calls to `maybeUnescape()` should\n    be deleted (unescaping will never be needed anymore).\n\n    The heuristic is as follows:\n    - For each LaTeX-like token (one or more backslashes followed by a special\n      character or by at least one letter) in the string:\n      - If the token cannot be unescaped (e.g. \\e ), return the original string.\n        Otherwise, we now have two candidate tokens: the original tokens\n        and the escaped tokens.\n      - For both the original and the unescaped token, compute a number that\n        indicates *how* LaTeX-like the token is:\n        - 6 if there's an odd number of backslashes followed by a valid LaTeX\n          macro name (all backslashes but the last form a sequence of LaTeX\n          newlines, and the last one starts the LaTeX macro)\n        - 4 if there's one backslash followed by a dollar sign\n          (this is likely intended to actually display a dollar sign)\n        - 3 if there's an even number of backslashes (this is a sequence of\n          LaTeX newlines, and the letters that follow are LaTeX math variables)\n        - 2 if there are no backslashes (this is valid, but not LaTeX)\n        - 1 if there's an odd number of backslashes (but more than one)\n          followed by a dollar sign (our strings don't currently contain this)\n        - 0 otherwise (if there's an odd number of backslashes followed by\n          something that isn't a valid LaTeX macro name)\n    - If exactly one of the candidate strings contains one or more tokens\n      that scored 0, return the other string. Otherwise, return the string\n      with the highest sum of token scores, choosing the unescaped string\n      if there's a tie.\n\n    This algorithm was implemented in Python and run against all of our current\n    Crowdin strings (about 440,000), both in original form and escaped form.\n    It *always* makes the correct guess for the original strings, and makes\n    the wrong guess only for 30 of the escaped strings.\n */\n\n// This regex captures sequences that might represent LaTeX or escape sequences\nvar MAYBE_LATEX_REGEX = /\\\\+([ !#$%*,.:;\\[\\]\\^_{|}]|[a-zA-Z]*)/g;\n\n// These are the LaTeX macros that are currently in use in our strings.\n// They were collected by applying the above regex to all of our\n// Crowdin strings, and manually removing most invalid macro names. Macro name\n// validity was tested by pasting the macros into the Perseus editor.\n// Invalid macros would typically be the result of the regex finding a sequence\n// of LaTeX newlines followed by regular text, e.g. \"\\\\\\\\xy = z\".

To multi-render a question, pass in the content of the item\n * to the `MultiRenderer` component as a props. Then, pass in a function which\n * takes an object of renderers (in the same structure as the content), and\n * return a render tree. The `MultiRenderer` component will allow you to\n * combine scores, serialized state, etc. without having to manually call on\n * each of the functions. It also handles inter-widgets requests between the\n * different renderers.\n * For more details, see `multi-items/multi-renderer.jsx`.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n *   item = {_multi: {\n *       left: <content data>,\n *       right: [<content data>, <content data>],\n *   }}\n *   shape = shapes.shape({\n *       left: shapes.content,\n *       right: shapes.arrayOf(shapes.content),\n *   })\n *\n *   <MultiRenderer item={item} shape={shape}>\n *       {({renderers}) =>\n *           <div>\n *               <div id=\"left\">{renderers.left}</div>\n *               <ul id=\"right\">\n *                   {renderers.right.map(r => <li>{r}</li>)}\n *               </ul>\n *           </div>\n *       }\n *   </MultiRenderer>\n *\n * This file also exposes `shapes`, which helps you construct a runtime type\n * declaration for your particular class of multi-item. This can then be used\n * to create a MultirendererEditor for your multi-item shape, and to validate\n * that a multi-item conforms to the shape via `buildPropTypeForShape`.\n * For more details, see `multi-items/shapes.js`.\n *\n * This file also exposes some utility functions for working with generic\n * multi-items, like `findContentNodesInItem`, `findHintNodesInItem`,\n * `inferItemShape`, and `buildEmptyItemForShape`.\n * For more details, see `multi-items/items.js`.\n */\nvar _require = require(\"./multi-items/items.js\"),\n    buildEmptyItemForShape = _require.buildEmptyItemForShape,\n    findContentNodesInItem = _require.findContentNodesInItem,\n    findHintNodesInItem = _require.findHintNodesInItem,\n    inferItemShape = _require.inferItemShape;\n\nvar MultiRenderer = require(\"./multi-items/multi-renderer.jsx\");\n\nvar _require2 = require(\"./multi-items/prop-type-builders.js\"),\n    buildPropTypeForShape = _require2.buildPropTypeForShape;\n\nvar shapes = require(\"./multi-items/shapes.js\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    // Tools for rendering your multi-items\n    MultiRenderer: MultiRenderer,\n\n    // Tools for declaring your multi-item shapes\n    shapes: shapes,\n    buildPropTypeForShape: buildPropTypeForShape,\n\n    // Tools for generically manipulating multi-items\n    buildEmptyItemForShape: buildEmptyItemForShape,\n    findContentNodesInItem: findContentNodesInItem,\n    findHintNodesInItem: findHintNodesInItem,\n    inferItemShape: inferItemShape\n};\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./src/multi-items.js\n ** module id = 30\n ** module chunks = 0 2\n **/","/* eslint-disable no-console, no-var, space-before-function-paren */\n/* TODO(csilvers): fix these lint errors (http://eslint.org/docs/rules): */\n/* To fix, remove an entry above, run ka-lint, and fix errors. */\n\nvar _ = require(\"underscore\");\n\nvar DEFAULT_ALIGNMENT = \"block\";\nvar DEFAULT_SUPPORTED_ALIGNMENTS = [\"default\"];\nvar DEFAULT_STATIC = false;\nvar DEFAULT_TRACKING = \"\";\nvar DEFAULT_LINTABLE = false;\n\nvar widgets = {};\nvar editors = {};\n\nvar Widgets = {\n    // Widgets must be registered to avoid circular dependencies with the\n    // core Editor and Renderer components.\n    register: function register(name, widget, editor) {\n        widgets[name] = widget;\n        editors[name] = editor;\n    },\n\n    registerMany: function registerMany(widgets) {\n        var _this = this;\n\n        widgets.forEach(function (_ref) {\n            var widget = _ref[0],\n                editor = _ref[1];\n\n            widget && _this.register(widget.name, widget, editor);\n        });\n\n        this.validateAlignments();\n    },\n\n    getWidget: function getWidget(name) {\n        // TODO(alex): Consider referring to these as renderers to avoid\n        // overloading \"widget\"\n        if (!_.has(widgets, name)) {\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        // Allow widgets to specify a widget directly or via a function\n        if (widgets[name].getWidget) {\n            return widgets[name].getWidget();\n        } else {\n            return widgets[name].widget;\n        }\n    },\n\n    getEditor: function getEditor(name) {\n        return _.has(editors, name) ?

Create a\n      * TreeTransformer by passing the root node of the tree to the\n      * constructor. Then traverse that tree by calling the traverse() method. The\n      * argument to traverse() is a callback function that will be called once for\n      * each node in the tree. This is a post-order depth-first traversal: the\n      * callback is not called on the a way down, but on the way back up. That is,\n      * the children of a node are traversed before the node itself is.\n      *\n      * The traversal callback function is passed three arguments, the node being\n      * traversed, a TraversalState object, and the concatentated text content of\n      * the node and all of its descendants. The TraversalState object is the most\n      * most interesting argument: it has methods for querying the ancestors and\n      * siblings of the node, and for deleting or replacing the node. These\n      * transformation methods are why this class is a tree transformer and not\n      * just a tree traverser.\n      *\n      * A typical tree traversal looks like this:\n      *\n      *   new TreeTransformer(root).traverse((node, state, content) => {\n      *       let parent = state.parent();\n      *       let previous = state.previousSibling();\n      *       // etc.\n      *   });\n      *\n      * The traverse() method descends through nodes and arrays of nodes and calls\n      * the traverse callback on each node on the way back up to the root of the\n      * tree. (Note that it only calls the callback on the nodes themselves, not\n      * any arrays that contain nodes.) A node is loosely defined as any object\n      * with a string-valued `type` property. Objects that do not have a type\n      * property are assumed to not be part of the tree and are not traversed. When\n      * traversing an array, all elements of the array are examined, and any that\n      * are nodes or arrays are recursively traversed. When traversing a node, all\n      * properties of the object are examined and any node or array values are\n      * recursively traversed.  In typical parse trees, the children of a node are\n      * in a `children` or `content` array, but this class is designed to handle\n      * more general trees.  The Perseus markdown parser, for example, produces\n      * nodes of type \"table\" that have children in the `header` and `cells`\n      * properties.\n      *\n      * CAUTION: the traverse() method does not make any attempt to detect\n      * cycles. If you call it on a cyclic graph instead of a tree, it will cause\n      * infinite recursion (or, more likely, a stack overflow).\n      *\n      * TODO(davidflanagan): it probably wouldn't be hard to detect cycles: when\n      * pushing a new node onto the containers stack we could just check that it\n      * isn't already there.\n      *\n      * If a node has a text-valued `content` property, it is taken to be the\n      * plain-text content of the node. The traverse() method concatenates these\n      * content strings and passes them to the traversal callback for each\n      * node. This means that the callback has access the full text content of its\n      * node and all of the nodes descendants.\n      *\n      * See the TraversalState class for more information on what information and\n      * methods are available to the traversal callback.\n      **/\n\n// TreeNode is the type of a node in a parse tree.

All changes must be done by\n      constructing new objects.

This is what allows backspacing a widget\n      to result in its deletion in Perseus\n    - Special styling is done using Decorators, which allow substituting text\n      content with a custom react element\n    - Modifier is a collection of helpful utilities for modification purposes\n\nTODO(samiskin): Make tasks such as \"addWidget\" and \"updateWidget\" not functions\n                that you call on the PerseusEditor component (Can do once this\n                fully replacess the old editor).\n*/\n\nvar React = require(\"react\");\n\nvar _require = require(\"draft-js\"),\n    CharacterMetadata = _require.CharacterMetadata,\n    Entity = _require.Entity,\n    Editor = _require.Editor,\n    EditorState = _require.EditorState,\n    CompositeDecorator = _require.CompositeDecorator,\n    ContentState = _require.ContentState,\n    Modifier = _require.Modifier,\n    genKey = _require.genKey,\n    getDefaultKeyBinding = _require.getDefaultKeyBinding,\n    KeyBindingUtil = _require.KeyBindingUtil;\n\nvar Widgets = require(\"./widgets.js\");\nvar DraftUtils = require(\"./draft-utils.js\");\n\n// This controls the minimum time between when updates for the parent\n// component are generated.

See tree-types.js for further\n * discussion.\n *\n * These functions enable us to manipulate generic multi-item-shaped trees,\n * regardless of what type of data they contain at their leaves. You can use\n * the mapper functions to transform a tree into another tree of the same\n * shape, or to discover all the nodes of a particular type.\n *\n * We expose two simple mapper functions (mapContentNodes and mapHintNodes),\n * and also a more complex interface for creating a mapping over all of a\n * tree's node types simultaneously:\n *\n * `buildMapper()` returns a TreeMapper object that allows you to build your\n * mapper object one node type at a time. Then, you can execute your mapping by\n * calling the `mapTree` method.\n *\n * For example:\n *     const renderers = buildMapper()\n *         .setContentMapper(this.renderContentNode)\n *         .setHintMapper(this.renderHintNode)\n *         .setTagsMapper(this.renderTagsNode)\n *         .setArrayMapper(this.hideSkippedQuestions)\n *         .mapTree(tree, shape);\n *\n * This will copy the given tree, apply the given transformations to the\n * content, hint, and array nodes respectively, and return the resulting tree.\n *\n * For node types whose mappers aren't specified, we default to the identity\n * function. (This builder interface enables us to implement that default\n * behavior in a provably type-safe way, while not requiring the call site to\n * be aware of all the node types. Hooray!)\n *\n * The call to `setArrayMapper` must come last, because the array mapper's\n * argument types depend on the other mappers' types. See ArrayMapper for more\n * details.\n *\n * WARNING: These functions trust that the provided tree conforms to the\n * provided shape.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal.
